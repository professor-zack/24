A digital version of the card game 24.

The original card game involves drawing 4 cards at random from a deck of playing cards (only the number cards are used, face cards are removed from the deck). The player(s) have to use arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and use of brackets where necessary) to try and produce the result of 24 using the 4 numbers drawn.

This is dedicated to my grandfather, who nurtured my passion for the sciences when I was a child and who now plays 24 to try and combat his early-stage dementia. I also played a fair deal of 24 as a child as well, and this game is a big reason why 24 is my favorite number.
