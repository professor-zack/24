This mini-project aims to create an algorithm to solve the problem of 24.

"Solving" 24 is defined as identifying and producing all possible solutions if there is one, or verifying that there is no solution if there isn't one.

The problem of 24 becomes considerably trickier due to how brackets are often used to arrive at a solution. For example, given the four numbers 1, 1, 4, 9, the only way to get 24 would be to subtract 1 from 9 to get 8, while separately subtracting the remaining 1 from 4 to get 3, then 8 times 3 gives 24. Mathematically, it would be (9-1)*(4-1) = 8*3 = 24. This is what I mean when I say brackets are used. Without the use of brackets in this case (as with many other possible combinations of 4 numbers), 24 would otherwise not be able to be derived. Or in other words, the order in which the arithmetic operations are carried out is critical to arriving at 24.
